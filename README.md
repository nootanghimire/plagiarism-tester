Background
---

Fed up with teachers, who used to deny project submission which was typed and printed (because they thought, everyone will copy-paste the thingo), I just planned to make a plagiarism tester so that they could find who copied whose!


This is only a core software! I'll have to work a bit more to complete my plan :p


Usage
---

Example: 


```bash
./main.py "file1.pdf" "file2.pdf"

```

Or,

```bash
./main.py -v "file1.pdf" "file2.pdf"

```
